This is an experiment with [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/) that got out of hands, I started making a class to detect touches inside given coordinates on a SKScene and went on from there.

I started by making a basic interface with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), created some icons for the three main menus and sliced the assets from there, then I got some color inspiration from [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com) for the backgrounds of the pads, and after that I started with the coding.

The custom transition for the menus is a nice snippet of code I originally made for [Infojobs](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/infojobs-trabajo-y-empleo-buscador-de-ofertas/id382581206?l=ca&mt=8) in the filters of the search engine, which I tweaked a bit for this app.

Then I started recording some sounds with the Pocket Operators plugged to the mac via an M-Audio sound interface, sliced them as well as I could with [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)(Don't laugh, it does the job), and these are the sounds found in _PrimalArcade_, _MartianRumble_ and _ButsBatsWoop_.

After that, it was guitar time. I plugged my really cheap and old guitar to the sound interface, amplified it via software with a lot of distorsion and reverberation until  that turned out to be nice to hear and...
You can try the sounds in the _Ethereal_ pad.

When everything was almost ready, I started playing with the app and the different rythm combinations I could find and tweaked the pads until it was good enough.

While doing that I realised the screen was getting too crowded for both hands, so I thought that an extra sound trigger would be nice, but normally, you only get 2 hands, so;

I had the BrilliantIdeaâ„¢ to grab the Apple Watch, strap it on my ankle, and then use the accelerometer to trigger a "Kick" sound.
Guess what, the apple reviewers aren't prepared to deal with a "put an apple watch on your ankle" situation so... _~~(this feature can be found anyway beause it was on the first version, just forgot to mention it because I knew they would be a pain in the ass)~~_

I hope that you can value my work, I know it's a glorified fart button app with a fart button watch app but, it is not :)
